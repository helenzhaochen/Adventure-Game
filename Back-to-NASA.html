                Dexter somehow went back to the supercomputer unnoticed without a clue. When he tried to talk to the computer, this time it worked and the supercomputer changed its screen to the cameras of the center.

                Dexter had an idea and rewinded back to the time the spaceship went missing. A screen interested him and he zoomed in. After hearing some people's conversation, he found out that the case of the missing spaceship was a lie, and they used that to cover a project that they were building.
